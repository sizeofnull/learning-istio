## Gateways

Gateways are used to receive incoming traffic.

## Deploying

There are two examples about gateways. A simple gateway, without rules and another
using prefix.

### Simple

```sh
kubectl apply -f examples/gateways/simple
```

### Prefix

```sh
kubectl apply -f examples/gateways/prefix
```
